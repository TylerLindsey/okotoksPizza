Also the src is not properly set, I have the logo downloaded but have not properly set that, that was simply the code Mark had. Go back and fix this once the requrements for the projects that are due Feb 1 and 2 are done.  -->

      This section is not necessary for the current assignment, but I think it is properly formatted just not properly sourced. I could embed the vector but then I'm not in control of the image if it gets changed or deleted by the owner. It is better to embed that small of an image, and I need to find the correct path to it.-->
