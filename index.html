    <!--the body, div, header etc. all have different indentation on different pages. I need to go through the different html pages and set them to be a consistant size, there is probably something I can download in the future, but let's do it manually for now so I can take a closer look at my code, and download something for the future to keep me organized from now on. Keep in mind that as I change the html, the css might be affected so I will have to keep a close eye on it. -->

This section is not necessary for the current assignment, but I think it is properly formatted just not properly sourced. I could embed the vector but then I'm not in control of the image if it gets changed or deleted by the owner. It is better to embed that small of an image, and I need to find the correct path to it.-->
